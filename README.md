# Sorting Visualizer Website

This is a web application that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms. Users can start sorting from the index page and navigate to the home page to select different sorting techniques and visualize their algorithms.

## Features

- **Index Page**: The index page contains a button to start sorting.
- **Home Page**: The home page lists six sorting techniques: selection sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, heap sort, merge sort, and quick sort. Users can click on any technique to visualize its algorithm.
- **Visualization Page**: The visualization page displays the sorting algorithm in action. Users can increase the speed of the algorithm, increase the size of the array, and generate a new array.
- **Sorting Techniques**: Each sorting technique abouts is separately, allowing users to see the process, time complexity, and space complexity of each algorithm.

## File Structure

- **index.html**: Landing page with a button to start sorting.
- **home.html**: Page with buttons to select sorting techniques.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Click on the "Start Sorting" button to navigate to the home page.
3. Select a sorting technique from the list.
4. Visualize the sorting algorithm on the visualization page.
5. Optionally, adjust the speed and size of the array or generate a new array.

## Technologies Used
